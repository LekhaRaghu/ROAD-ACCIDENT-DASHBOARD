# ROAD-ACCIDENT-DASHBOARD
Comparing road accidents by location and severity between the current and previous years

INTRODUCTION: Road Accident Dashboard involves gathering, analyzing, and visually representing data related to road accidents to aid in understanding trends, identifying high-risk areas, and facilitating decision-making for improvements in road safety. Such a dashboard can be crucial for government agencies, urban planners, and the general public, offering insights into accident frequencies, causes, locations, and times. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of what goes into creating and using a Road Accident Dashboard.

DATA/ OPERATIONS ABSTRACTION DESIGN: The data used is downloaded from the Kaggle. Identified missing values and determined whether to fill them, ignore them, or remove the data points entirely.
Rectified any inaccuracies or anomalies in the data, such as impossible values (e.g., negative numbers for accident counts).Eliminated duplicate records to ensure each accident is only counted once

FUTURE WORK: At this point, no future work is planned.As you mentioned in comments maybe I will try to have previous year always be populated with year-1 so that I do not have to select it.
